# Reddit_SparkML
This repository contains the code and output of a project examining several months of Reddit comments as a way to use my SparkML skills

The project.txt file and the WriteUp.docx are essentially the same file: the write-up of the project. Start here.
The Notebook that starts with dbh52 contains the primary SparkML code
The other notebook contains code to create a few visualizations
